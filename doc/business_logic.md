Step 4 â€” Keyword Discovery (Mixed Sources)

	â€¢	Goal: Build a list of potential keywords, even in niche/low-volume markets.
	â€¢	Task: Use a mix of AI generation, translation (EN â†’ HE), and any available tool data (Google Ads, DataForSEO) to gather relevant search terms.

Step 5 â€” Keyword Metrics (If Available)
	â€¢	Role: SEO Analyst
	â€¢	Goal: Add context and prioritize keywords with whatever signals exist.

	â€¢	Role: SEO Strategist
	â€¢	Goal: Group keywords into clusters that represent content opportunities.

Step 7 â€” Foundational Content Plan (Final Output)
	â€¢	Role: Content Strategist
	â€¢	Goal: Translate keyword clusters into a starter content plan for a weak/empty site.
	â€¢	Task:
	â€¢	Define 3â€“5 content pillars (themes).
	â€¢	Map each to funnel stages (awareness, consideration, decision).
	â€¢	Recommend content types (blog, guide, FAQ, landing page).
	â€¢	Prioritize quick wins vs. long-term plays.
	â€¢	Provide 10â€“15 content ideas that could be executed immediately.

âœ… Key Differences from Full SEO Strategy
	â€¢	Simplified journey (basic funnel, not multi-touch advanced).
	â€¢	Mixed keyword sources (AI + translation + Ads if available).
	â€¢	Metrics optional (not all fields required in low-data environments).
	â€¢	No competitor benchmarking (out of scope for Foundation).
	â€¢	Final output = Foundational Content Plan (not a fully matured long-term strategy).
