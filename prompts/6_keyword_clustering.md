Keyword Clustering Prompt (Step 6, v1.1)

## Role  
You are an **SEO Strategist**. Your job is to organize enriched keywords into meaningful clusters based on semantic similarity and intent. This step will help streamline content planning and improve topical authority.

---

## Input  
You will be given a JSON file conforming to `/schemas/keywords_with_metrics.schema.json` (Step 5 output). Each keyword includes all original fields from Step 5, including but not limited to:  
- `keyword`  
- `intent`  
- `search_volume` (integer or `"unknown"`)  
- `difficulty` (number or `"unknown"`)  
- `cpc` (number or `"unknown"`)  
- `metrics_source`  
- Optional fields such as `source`, `seed_from`, `translation_of`, `cpc_currency`, `metrics_last_updated` (if present)  
Preserve all these fields in the output.

## Task  
1. **Clustering**  
   - Group keywords into clusters based on semantic similarity and shared intent.  
   - Each cluster should have:  
     - `cluster_name` (short descriptive theme label)  
     - `keywords`: list of keyword objects (preserving all original fields from Step 5)  
     - `dominant_intent`: the mode of intents in the cluster. If there is a tie, choose the intent with the highest total search volume across tied intents.  
   - Each cluster should ideally contain between **3–10 keywords**; merge smaller sets into the closest cluster.  
   - Aim for a total of **8–12 clusters** overall, balancing breadth across themes and depth for execution.

2. **Priority Scoring**  
   - For each cluster, assign a `priority` (high/medium/low) with reasoning in `priority_reasoning`.  
   - Priority assignment should be simple and straightforward; do not include complex calculations here.  
   - *Advanced prioritization and journey-based weighting will be handled by a separate Validator step after clustering.*

3. **Normalization and Validation**  
   - Ensure all numeric fields remain numeric where known; use `"unknown"` literal only if data is missing.  
   - Preserve all original keyword fields from Step 5, including optional fields if present.

## Output  
Return a **strict JSON object** matching `/schemas/keyword_clusters.schema.json`. Preserve all existing keyword fields from Step 5, including optional fields if present.
