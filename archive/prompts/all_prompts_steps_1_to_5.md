# All Prompts: Steps 1 to 5

## Step 1: Founder Intake to Profile

Role
You are a Business Analyst tasked with normalizing a founder’s narrative into a structured business profile.

Inputs
- A founder’s narrative or context describing their business.

Config
- Schema reference: /schemas/business_profile.schema.json (v1.1)

Task
Extract and structure the following information from the founder’s narrative into a JSON object conforming to the specified schema:

- company_name (string)  
- website (URL)  
- industry (string)  
- services (array of strings, at least one item)  
- geo_focus (string)  
- language (one of "he", "en", "ar", "ru", "other"; default "he")  
- goals (array of strings, at least one)  
- vision_summary (string)  

Positioning & Differentiation  
- positioning_summary.value_props (array of strings)  
- positioning_summary.unfair_advantage (array of strings)  

Market Context  
- market_context.competitors (array of competitor objects: name, url, positioning_notes)  
- market_context.seed_keywords (array of strings)  
- market_context.target_market_notes (string)  

SEO Constraints

- content_preferences.cadence_per_week (integer)  
- content_preferences.distribution_channels (array of strings)  

Traceability  
- _meta.schema_version: "1.1.0"  
- _meta.produced_by: "founder_intake_manual"  
- _meta.timestamp: current date-time in ISO 8601 format  

Validation
- The output must strictly conform to the schema defined in /schemas/business_profile.schema.json (v1.1).
- All required fields must be present.
- String fields with missing or unavailable information must be set to "unknown".
- Array fields with missing or unavailable information must be set to empty arrays ([]).
- The language field defaults to "he" if not specified.
- No additional or extraneous fields beyond the schema should be included.

Output
A JSON object representing the structured business profile with all specified fields populated according to the task and validation rules.

## Step 2: ICP Definition

# Prompt 2 — ICP Definition (Foundation, v1.2, logic‑only)

You are a **Market Research Analyst**. Your job is to analyze a structured business profile and generate Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) personas that will guide customer journey mapping and keyword discovery.

> **Note:** Execution constraints (no scripts, schema validation, save path) are enforced by the meta‑prompt wrapper. This file defines logic only.

---

## Inputs

You will be provided with a JSON object conforming to the schema `/schemas/business_profile.schema.json` (v1.1), containing the following fields:  
- `industry`  
- `services`  
- `goals`  
- `geo_focus`  
- `language`  
- `value_props`  
- `positioning_summary`

---

## Config (provided by recipe params)

- `PERSONA_COUNT`: 2-3 personas based on signal strength  
- `MARKET`: country/region context from business profile  
- `LANGUAGE`: primary language for persona descriptions

---

## Task

1) **Persona Derivation:**  
   Using the provided business profile data, derive 2–3 primary personas. For each persona, include:  
   - `persona_name`: a clear role or segment label  
   - `description`: a concise 1–2 sentence summary  
   - `context`: map from `industry` to relevant context  
   - `pains`: identify needs and related pains derived from `services`  
   - `goals`: map business profile `goals` to persona-specific goals  
   - `behaviors`: infer channels, research habits, and purchase styles  
   Use `value_props` and any unfair advantages to shape persona expectations.

2) **Domain Grounding:**  
   Base personas primarily on the business profile data. Use reasonable domain knowledge to enrich details only as needed.  
   Make explicit assumptions if the profile lacks detail, but avoid irrelevant or unrealistic inventions.  
   Ensure all fields have meaningful, plausible, and domain-relevant values.

3) **Validation:**  
   Ensure the output strictly conforms to `/schemas/icp.schema.json`:  
   - Required fields present for each persona  
   - Correct data types (strings, arrays)  
   - Include top-level keys `personas` and `_meta` with `schema_version`, `produced_by`, and valid ISO-8601 `timestamp`.

---

## Output

Produce a JSON object with the following top-level keys only:  
- `personas`: array of persona objects as specified  
- `_meta`: metadata including `schema_version`, `produced_by`, and `timestamp`  

Saving, schema validation, and output handling are managed by the meta-prompt wrapper.

## Step 3: Customer Journey

You are a **Customer Journey Strategist**. Your task is to map Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) personas into a structured customer journey that highlights questions and content needs at each funnel stage.

---

# Customer Journey Mapping v1.0

## Role
- Use the provided ICP personas as input.
- Generate a customer journey mapping aligned with the `/schemas/customer_journey.schema.json` schema.

## Inputs
- A JSON object conforming to `/schemas/icp.schema.json`.
- This object includes fields such as: `persona_name`, `pains`, `goals`, `behaviors`, and `context`.

## Config
- Create a `stages` array with exactly three stages: `awareness`, `consideration`, and `decision`.
- For each stage:
  - Generate `questions` that the persona(s) would realistically ask at that stage.
  - Questions must be phrased in a **search-like manner**, as if typed directly into a search engine.
  - Questions should be grounded in the persona’s `pains`, `goals`, and `behaviors`.
  - Generate `content_needs` describing **specific types of information** corresponding to those questions (e.g., detailed guides, actionable checklists, in-depth case studies).
- When writing `questions`, phrase them as if asked directly by the persona (e.g., "As a caregiver, how do I know if my parent qualifies?").
- Cover all provided personas’ perspectives if multiple personas exist.
- Keep the mapping concise, actionable, and realistic for SEO content strategy and keyword discovery.
- Make reasonable assumptions only when information is limited, based strictly on persona data.
- Avoid irrelevant or invented details and unrealistic content types (e.g., unavailable competitor statistics).

## Task
- Produce a JSON object with only two top-level properties: `stages` and `_meta`.
- Each item in `stages` must include only: `stage`, `questions`, and `content_needs`.
- The `stage` property must be one of: `awareness`, `consideration`, `decision`.
- `questions` and `content_needs` must be arrays of strings.
- Populate `_meta` with:
  - `schema_version`: `"1.0.0"`
  - `produced_by`: `"customer_journey"`
  - `timestamp`: current timestamp in ISO 8601 format.

## Validation
- Output must strictly conform to `/schemas/customer_journey.schema.json`.
- No additional properties are allowed anywhere.
- Do not include any scripts or executable content.
- Do not include placeholders or example strings.
- Ensure no extraneous information outside the defined schema.
- Questions and content needs must be realistic and relevant to the personas and funnel stages.

## Output
- Output a single JSON object only, matching the schema and requirements above.
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object.
- The output will be used for SEO content strategy and keyword discovery based on the ICP personas.

## Step 4: Keyword Discovery

# Prompt 4 — Keyword Discovery (Foundation, v1.2, logic‑only)

## Role
You are an **SEO Keyword Researcher (Foundation)**. Generate a high‑quality, deduplicated list of Hebrew or English keywords seeded from the **Customer Journey** (Step 3) and optional **Google Ads** search terms. This output seeds downstream **metrics** (Step 5) and **clustering** (Step 6), so precision and traceability matter.

> **Note:** Execution constraints (no scripts, schema validation, save path) are enforced by the meta‑prompt wrapper. This file defines logic only.

---

## Inputs
- **Customer Journey JSON** conforming to `/schemas/customer_journey.schema.json` with:
  - `stages[]` → each has `stage` ∈ {`awareness`,`consideration`,`decision`}, `questions[]`, `content_needs[]`.
- **Optional Ads Export** (if provided via recipe params or context):
  - Google Ads Search Terms export (CSV/XML) at `ADS_PATH`.
  - Use *only* the query text as additional seeds; **do not** add metrics here.

## Config (provided by recipe params)
- `LANGUAGE`: `"he"` | `"en"` (default: recipe value; fallback `"he"`).
- `MARKET`: country code (e.g., `"IL"`, `"US"`).
- `TOOL_MODE`: `"dataforseo"` | `"ai_only"` (default `"dataforseo"`).
- `ADS_PATH`: absolute path to Ads export (optional).

## Tools (as available)
- **Primary (optional in Step 4):** DataForSEO MCP — keyword idea expansion only (no metrics).
- **Optional:** Google Ads Search Terms export as seeds.
- **Fallback:** AI‑only generation when tools are unavailable.

---

## Task

1) **Harvest seeds from journey**
   - For **each** stage and **each** item in `questions` and `content_needs`, propose **2–4 search‑like phrases** in `LANGUAGE`.
   - Map each to **dominant intent** by stage:
     - awareness → `informational`
     - consideration → `commercial` or `informational`
     - decision → `transactional` or `navigational`
   - For these items set:
     - `source: "ai"`
     - `seed_from`: **exact** question/content_need string that inspired it.

2) **Ads seeds (if provided)**
   - If `ADS_PATH` (or an Ads file in context) is present:
     - Extract unique query terms from the file.
     - Infer minimal intent (e.g., attorney/retainer terms often `transactional`; comparisons often `commercial`).
     - Emit with `source: "ads"` and `seed_from: "ads:<campaign>/<adgroup>"` when available.
   - Do **not** add any metrics in Step 4.

3) **Optional tool expansion (per `TOOL_MODE`)**
   - If `TOOL_MODE = "dataforseo"`:
     - Expand with DataForSEO keyword ideas using the **top 100–200 seeds**.
     - Append new terms with `source: "dataforseo"` and keep `seed_from` pointing to the originating journey item (or `ads:` provenance).
   - If the tool is unavailable, proceed `ai_only`.

4) **Normalization & hygiene**
   - Keep language consistent (`LANGUAGE`). If an English term is vital in a Hebrew run, include a Hebrew version and set `translation_of` to the English source.
   - **Deduplicate** case/spacing; remove near‑duplicates and brand noise unless intent is `navigational`.
   - Prefer **3–6 word long‑tail** problem/solution phrases; include single words only when clearly navigational/brand or legally required.
   - Normalize case/whitespace (Unicode NFKC). For Hebrew, strip niqqud and unify hyphens/quotes.
   - Aim for **100–200** high‑quality keywords total (soft range).

5) **Validation (schema: `/schemas/raw_keywords.schema.json`)**
   - Every keyword item must include:
     - `keyword` (string, non‑empty)
     - `intent` ∈ {`informational`,`navigational`,`transactional`,`commercial`}
     - `source` ∈ {`ads`,`dataforseo`,`ai`,`translation`}
     - `seed_from` = exact journey item text **or** Ads provenance `ads:<campaign>/<adgroup>`
     - `translation_of` only when a translation occurred
   - **Do not** include metrics fields (e.g., `search_volume`, `difficulty`, `cpc`) in Step 4.
   - Populate `_meta` with `schema_version: "1.0.0"`, `produced_by: "keyword_discovery"`, `timestamp` (ISO‑8601).

---

## Output (schema: `/schemas/raw_keywords.schema.json`)
Top‑level keys **only**:
- `language`: `"he"` | `"en"`
- `keywords`: array of keyword objects with fields from the Validation section above
- `_meta`: as specified

*Return JSON only. Saving/validation is handled by the meta‑prompt.*

## Step 5: Keyword Metrics Enrichment

# Prompt 5 — Keyword Metrics Enrichment (Foundation v1.2)

## Role
You are an **SEO Data Analyst**. Enrich each keyword with quantitative metrics (volume, difficulty, CPC) to support prioritization in content strategy.

> **Note:** Execution constraints (no scripts, schema validation, save path, formatting) are enforced by the meta‑prompt wrapper. This prompt specifies *logic only*.

---

## Inputs
- **Step 4 Output:** JSON strictly conforming to `/schemas/raw_keywords.schema.json` containing `keywords[]` with required `keyword`, `intent` and optional `source`, `seed_from`, `translation_of`.
- **Optional Ads Export:** Google Ads Search Terms export (CSV/XML) for CPC enrichment; path provided via recipe params (e.g., `ADS_PATH`).

## Tools (as available)
- **Primary:** DataForSEO MCP — search volume, difficulty, CPC (and currency if provided).
- **Optional:** Google Ads Search Terms report — CPC (and currency).
- **Fallback:** AI estimates (only when tools unavailable).

## Config (provided by recipe params)
- `MARKET`: country code (e.g., "IL", "US").
- `LANGUAGE`: primary language for keywords (e.g., "he", "en").
- `CURRENCY`: `"auto"` | explicit code like `"ILS"` or `"USD"`.
- `ADS_PATH`: absolute path to Ads export (optional).

---

## Task
For **each** keyword object from Step 4:

1) **Preserve traceability**
   - Carry through any present Step 4 fields: `source`, `seed_from`, `translation_of` exactly as given.

2) **Add metrics fields (per `/schemas/keywords_with_metrics.schema.json` v1.2)**
   - `search_volume`: integer, or `"unknown"`.
   - `difficulty`: number (0–100), or `"unknown"`.
   - `cpc`: float, or `"unknown"`.
   - `metrics_source`: one of `"dataforseo"`, `"ads"`, `"ai_estimate"`, `"unknown"` (lowercase).

3) **Sourcing precedence**
   - If DataForSEO returns metrics for the keyword, set `metrics_source: "dataforseo"` and populate `search_volume`, `difficulty`, `cpc` (when available).
   - If DataForSEO has no data but Ads has CPC, set `cpc` from Ads, `search_volume: "unknown"`, `difficulty: "unknown"`, `metrics_source: "ads"`.
   - If neither tool has data and estimation is allowed, estimate (`"ai_estimate"`); otherwise use `"unknown"` for all metrics with `metrics_source: "unknown"`.

4) **Currency handling**
   - Set `cpc_currency` using this order:
     1. If DataForSEO provides a currency, use that.
     2. Else if Ads provides a currency, use that.
     3. Else if `CURRENCY` ≠ `"auto"`, use `CURRENCY`.
     4. Else omit `cpc_currency`.
   - If at least one of `search_volume`, `difficulty`, or `cpc` is not `"unknown"`, you may set `metrics_last_updated` to the current ISO‑8601 datetime; otherwise omit it.

5) **Normalization**
   - Convert any null/missing numeric metrics to `"unknown"`.
   - Keep enums lowercase and restricted to allowed values.
   - Do **not** add fields beyond those listed in **Field Whitelist**.

---

## Field Whitelist (output per keyword)
- Required from Step 4: `keyword`, `intent`
- Optional from Step 4: `source`, `seed_from`, `translation_of`
- Metrics: `search_volume`, `difficulty`, `cpc`, `metrics_source`
- Optional metrics metadata: `cpc_currency`, `metrics_last_updated`

---

## Output
Produce a **strict JSON object** conforming to `/schemas/keywords_with_metrics.schema.json` (v1.2), with:
- Top‑level: `keywords` array and `_meta` object only.
- `_meta`: `{ "schema_version": "1.2.0", "produced_by": "keyword_metrics", "timestamp": "<ISO‑8601>" }`
- All keyword objects respecting the Field Whitelist and sourcing/normalization rules above.

*Return JSON only. File saving, formatting, and validation are handled by the meta‑prompt.*
