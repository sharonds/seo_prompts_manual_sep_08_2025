## Summary

I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

### Git and Repository Setup
- **Initialized Git repository**: Created a new git repo in the workspace.
- **Staged and committed all files**: Committed 28 files with the message "Initial commit: SEO prompts manual project setup".
- **Created GitHub repository**: Used `gh repo create` to create a private repository named `seo_prompts_manual_sep_08_2025` under your GitHub account (sharonds).
- **Pushed to remote**: The main branch is now pushed to `https://github.com/sharonds/seo_prompts_manual_sep_08_2025.git`.

### Python Environment
- **Created virtual environment**: Set up a Python 3.9.6 virtual environment in the `` directory.
- **Added .gitignore**: Created a comprehensive `.gitignore` file to exclude Python-related files, virtual environments, and common IDE/OS files.
- **Committed and pushed .gitignore**: Added the `.gitignore` in a separate commit and pushed it.

### Next Steps
To activate the Python environment in future sessions, run:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

The repository is now set up and ready for development. All files are committed and pushed to GitHub.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a **manual execution pipeline for an SEO content strategy framework**. It's designed as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to validate the business logic before automating the process.

### Core Purpose
The project provides a **7-step SEO strategy pipeline** that transforms founder input into a comprehensive content strategy. Each step is executed manually using AI prompts (via VS Code Copilot) rather than automated scripts.

### Key Components

#### 📁 **Structure**
- **``**: 7 detailed AI prompts (one per step) + a summarizer
- **``**: JSON schemas defining input/output structures for each step
- **``**: Sample input files and empty output templates
- **``**: Product Requirements Document (PRD) explaining the manual execution flow

#### 🚀 **7-Step Pipeline Flow**
1. **Founder Intake → Business Profile**: Converts vague founder notes into structured business profile
2. **ICP Definition**: Defines Ideal Customer Profile
3. **Customer Journey Mapping**: Maps customer touchpoints and pain points
4. **Keyword Discovery**: Discovers relevant keywords (can use AI + external tools like DataForSEO/Firecrawl)
5. **Keyword Metrics**: Analyzes keyword performance metrics
6. **Keyword Clustering**: Groups keywords into thematic clusters
7. **Content Strategy**: Creates content pillars with funnel stages, narratives, and priorities

#### 🎯 **Key Features**
- **Manual Execution**: Each step runs individually in VS Code with Copilot Agent
- **Structured Data**: All inputs/outputs follow strict JSON schemas
- **Quality Validation**: Designed to test output quality before automation
- **Modular Design**: Each prompt is standalone with embedded schemas
- **Client-Specific**: Outputs saved per client/date in `/client/date/` structure

#### 📋 **Execution Process**
1. User opens VS Code with Copilot Agent
2. Selects appropriate prompt from ``
3. Provides input JSON from ``
4. AI generates output following the schema
5. Saves result to ``
6. Repeats for all 7 steps
7. Optionally uses summarizer to generate human-readable explanations

#### 🎨 **Business Value**
- **Speed + Quality**: Optimized for manual mode to validate approach
- **Structured SEO Strategy**: Transforms founder vision into actionable content pillars
- **Scalable Foundation**: Manual validation before building automated orchestrator
- **Tool Integration Ready**: Some steps can leverage external APIs (DataForSEO, Firecrawl)

This is essentially a **proof-of-concept framework** for SEO content strategy generation, structured as a manual pipeline to ensure high-quality outputs before investing in automation infrastructure.
